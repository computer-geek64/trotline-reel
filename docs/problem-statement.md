# Problem Statement
*February 21st, 2019*

Trotlines are unsafe, time-consuming, and exhausting to handle. Crabbers must manually pull up/put out 1,200 feet of line on average at least twice a day. As a result, direct contact with the trotline can lead to infections caused by Salmonella, Vibrio, and other bacteria. These infections are dangerous, and can potentially lead to sickness, amputations, or death. In 2018, approximately 80,000 people were infected with [Vibriosis](https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/index.html) in the United States. Furthermore, [Salmonella](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html) causes nearly 1.2 million illnesses per year in the United States. Lastly, manually retracting and releasing the trotline frequently results in disorderly tangles that can set crabbers hours behind schedule.

## Outline
* Trotlines are unsafe, time-consuming, and exhausting when pulling up and putting out
* Infections caused by Salmonella, Vibrio, and other bacteria are potentially dangerous and can lead to amputations and/or death
* Crabbers must pull up/put out their lines at least once or twice a day.
* In total, crabbers have around 1,200 ft. of line
* Pulling up and putting out trotline by hand can cause many tangles
