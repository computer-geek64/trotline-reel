# Design Brief
*February 21st, 2019*

A trotline reel could solve all of the hazardous problems caused by direct contact with a trotline. The trotline reel will limit physical contact with bait and brackish water to a minimum, preventing infections of various diseases. The reel can be either manually or mechanically powered, and will help to facilitate the process required to retract and release the trotline. Additionally, the trotline will be free of tangles and compacted for minimal storage, featuring easy attachment and removal.

## Outline

* Both of which contain dangerous bacteria
* This reel will either be manually or mechanically powered
* Lessens risk of infection
* Easy to reel in or out
* Less chance of becoming tangled
