							<li>Presentation and justification of the problem
								<ol type="1">
									<li>Problem statement
										<p>&emsp;Crabbing trotlines are efficient way for both commercial and recreational crabbers to catch crabs. But trotlines are far from flawless; unlike traps, it can take around 30 minutes to pull up and put out the 1200 feet of line that makes up a trotline, but once they are in the water, crabs can be caught at a much faster rate. Because of this time and effort required to move a trotline, many crabbers will avoid moving their lines, even if they are beginning to catching less crabs, and when they do move their lines, these crabbers are exposing themselves to potentially lethal bacteria that can be found in the bait, crabs, and water.This bacteria can cause infections that are fairly dangerous, and can potentially lead to hospitalization, amputations, or death. Another mentionable issue of trotlines are tangle. Tangles in the line can take anywhere from a couple of seconds to fix, to the rest of the day on the water.</p>
										<p>&emsp;Vibro can be found in raw seafood, shellfish, and in salt and brackish water. In 2018, approximately 80,000 people were infected with Vibriosis in the United States. Most people recover within 3 days with no lasting effects. However, people with a <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. One fifth of the people with this kind of infection die, and only within a few days of becoming infected.</p>
										<p>&emsp;Salmonella is a  bacteria that typically lives in animal and human intestines and can be found in  feces. The most common method of infection is through contaminated water or food, but can also be contracted by handling animals and raw meat, which crabbers use as bait. Salmonella causes nearly 1.2 million illnesses per year in the United States. Most who have a salmonella infection will have no symptoms, while others can develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within 1 to 3 days. Most recover within a few days without treatment. Those who do not recover may suffer from severe dehydration, due to the long term effects of diarrhea, which may require medical attention. The longer someone suffers from the effects of salmonella, the higher the chance that they may develop life-threatening conditions, especially if the infection spreads beyond your intestines.</p>

											<li>Vomiting</li>
											<li>Abdominal cramps</li>

									</li>
									<li>Design brief
										<p>&emsp;A trotline reel could solve all of the hazardous problems caused by direct contact with a trotline. The trotline reel will limit physical contact with bait and brackish water, preventing infections of various diseases. The reel can be either manually or mechanically powered, and will help to facilitate the process required to retract and release the trotline. Additionally, the trotline will be free of tangles and compacted for minimal storage, featuring easy attachment and removal.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Justification and analysis of prior solution attempts
								<p>&emsp;Through our experiences, we know that there is at least one other main alternative to our trotline reel design. The <a href="http://www.chesapeakewinder.com/prices.html">Chesapeake Winder</a> is a motorized trotline winder that spools the line into a basket of your choice. It does not load the line onto the reel. Instead, it takes the place of someone bringing the line in by hand. The device also requires the trotline to be in tension to keep the line running through the horizontal winder plates. This may result in usage difficulty and user frustration if the line falls off the device. The unit itself costs upwards of $745 and runs on a 12V electric motor. It can be mounted using the fishing rod holders and is easily detachable or it can be physically bolted to the boat. Our design will hopefully be significantly less expensive and more convenient with the integration of a reel. Other prior solutions include non-marketed, and personal devices that solve the problem of handling a trotline. Crabbers and other watermen tend to be ingenious and have an aptitude for creating practical devices, so there is a good chance that someone has already created their own trotline reel perfectly suited for their boat and crabbing needs. However, the goal with our design is to create a marketable product that is useful and as universal as possible. Our product would also have a longer life-span and sturdier construction compared to possible personal solutions.</p>

								<br>
							</li>
							<li>Presentation and justification of solution design requirements
								<p>&emsp;In order to minimize contact with the disease-prone trotline, we decided that the solution would be to have a reel and crank to load the line back on the boat and to set the trotline out. All that would be required of the operator is turning of the crank and moving of the boat to allow the trotline to set itself in place. The solution also needed to hold either two 600 foot trotlines or one 1200 foot trotline because some crabbers decide to use two lines, but the maximum span of a trotline is 1200 feet. Furthermore, the solution must be able to be mounted to as many boat types as possible in the most secure way possible.In order to have a marketable product, it is absolutely necessary to create a product that is useable by a broad consumer base. Almost every boat on the water is different, so the trotline reel will need to have a universal method of mounting or be adaptable to common crabbing boats. As far as physical requirements, the entire setup may be close to 60 pounds when loaded with a trotline, so strength is a primary priority. The material chosen to create the product will have to be rust resistant and maintain quality in a brackish water environment.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Design concept generation, analysis, and selection
								<p>&emsp;After we decided what was required for this reel in order to reach our design specifications, we began to create concepts for the design. We formulated various design concepts for each element of the reel, including reel concepts, mounting concepts, and rotation concepts; as displayed on our <a href="http://trotline-reel.serveo.net/design.html">website</a>. After creating a considerable amount of ideas and recording them, we began to analyze the pros and cons to each idea. We looked at things such as complexity, viability, and costs. Through extensive research and analysis, we decided upon using the tri-plate reel, a mechanism of our own design, the bracket mount. unfortunately, we determined that the inclusion of a rotation concept would be unnecessary and would just overcomplicate this process.</p>
								<p>&emsp;The tri-plate reel is basic in design but for our purposes it is just what we need. This reel, sized to fit 1200 feet (the legal limit) of line, has a plate on either end of the axel with a freemoving plate between them. This plate is meant to separate the reel into two parts, allowing crabbers to put two 600 foot trotlines onto a single reel. This plate can be move to either end to allow space for a 1200 ft line if the crabber prefers using a single line.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="img/slideshow/TriplateReel.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 25px;">
								<p>&emsp;The bracket mount is the use of bracket and screws to fix the reel to the boat. This concept was most appealing because of the fact that it was the most versatile. Although it requires being physically attached to the boat,  a crabber won’t have to worry about the reel not being compatible to their ship. A similar idea, the vise grip, could be attached and detached from most ships without physical attachment. The problem with this design was that it would easily become loose, unlike the bracket mount, and losing your reel due to this design would be would be unacceptable, so we went with the bracket mount.</p>

							</li>
							<li>Application of STEM principles and practices
								<p>&emsp;The majority of our mathematical calculations contributed to finding the perfect size trotline reel. We used the volume of a cylinder to determine how much line and bait could fit on our 12” diameter and 14” wide cylindrical reel and compared that with the volume of a 1200 foot line with bait on it. We also used engineering principles to design our prototype which is still under construction, but reflects the concepts we decided to incorporate in our final design (See design process section D). We used our concept designs and available materials to create a working prototype that is still under construction. While working on the prototype, we were able to use the laser cutter to vector cut 3 plastic cardboard disks. We used Autodesk AutoCAD to create a simple 12” wide circle that was the template for the vector cut and ultimately, we used the the 3 circles as end plates on the reel prototype. We have not conducted any studies or tests on our prototype, as it still needs to be refined and finished.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="img/research/reel-calculations.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 25px;">
							</li>
							<li>Consideration of design viability
								<p>&emsp;Design viability will ultimately be rooted in our success with a mounting system. If we create an efficient, easy to use, and universal mounting system, the trotline reel will be a viable product for consumer purchase. The viability of an actual trotline reel rests in our marketing of necessity. If we market the product as a solution to disease exposure, crabbers will consider purchase even more so than just viewing the product as a convenience.

									&emsp;To physically show our design concepts, we used any available materials we had in the classroom to attempt to create a working prototype. Precision was sacrificed to show the concept as accurately as possible with the materials we had.
