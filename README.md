# Trotline Reel
*February 21st, 2019*

## Problem Statement and Design Brief

### Problem Statement
Trotlines are unsafe, time-consuming, and exhausting to handle. Crabbers must manually pull up/put out 1,200 feet of line on average at least twice a day. As a result, direct contact with the trotline can lead to infections caused by Salmonella, Vibrio, and other bacteria. These infections are dangerous, and can potentially lead to sickness, amputations, or death. In 2018, approximately 80,000 people were infected with [Vibriosis](https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/index.html) in the United States. Furthermore, [Salmonella](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html) causes nearly 1.2 million illnesses per year in the United States. Lastly, manually retracting and releasing the trotline frequently results in disorderly tangles that can set crabbers hours behind schedule.

### Design Brief
A trotline reel could solve all of the hazardous problems caused by direct contact with a trotline. The trotline reel will limit physical contact with bait and brackish water to a minimum, preventing infections of various diseases. The reel can be either manually or mechanically powered, and will help to facilitate the process required to retract and release the trotline. Additionally, the trotline will be free of tangles and compacted for minimal storage, featuring easy attachment and removal.

## To do
