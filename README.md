# Trotline Reel
*February 19th, 2019*



## Problem Statement
* Trotlines are unsafe, time-consuming, and exhausting when pulling up and putting out
* Infections caused by Salmonella, Vibrio, and other bacteria are potentially dangerous and can lead to amputations and/or death
* Crabbers must pull up/put out their lines at least once or twice a day.
* In total, crabbers have around 1,200 ft. of line
* Pulling up and putting out trotline by hand can cause many tangles

## To do
- [ ] Get statistical information about how long it would take to pull in/put out a trotline of approximately 1,200 ft.

## Design Brief
* Our solution to these issues is the use of a reel
* This trotline reel will keep crabbers from directly handling the bait and coming in contact with the brackish water.
* Both of which contain dangerous bacteria
* This reel will either be manually or mechanically powered
* Lessens risk of infection
* Easy to reel in or out
* Less chance of becoming tangled
* Features easy storage
